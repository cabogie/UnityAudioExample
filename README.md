# Unity Audio Example
I added comments to the scripts to explain some Unity stuff.

Should be able to get an idea of C# features too, it's pretty readable and self explanatory.

There are 4 scripts:
 - Wave
     - This is a component that creates an audio clip
 - DataSeedRandomFilter
     - example of an audio filter    
 - WaveMath
     - some simple math functions for generating audio
 - RRandom
     - my own simple pseudo random generating code (and some useful helpers)
